## FYI

Since I am only one person, and I mainly like working with Chromebooks (because
they are very cheap and easy to put into developer mode to install a working
Linux system, via [the crouton environment](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton)), 
this project is currently only very useful for Chromium-based browsers.

My next priority is to make this project also work well with Firefox browsers in 
various Linux distributions.
