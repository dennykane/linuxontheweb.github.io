## FYI

Since I am only one person, and I mainly like working with Chromebooks in developer
mode (using [the crouton environment](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton)), 
this project is currently only very useful for Chromium-based browsers.

My next priority is to make this project also work well with Firefox browsers in 
various Linux distributions.
