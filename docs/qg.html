Consider a finite, Gaussian-like, continuous field of scalar values<sup>2</sup>
in a Euclidean space of <i>n-</i>dimensions.  I denote the set of radially
symmetric terminal points of the field as "the boundary".  It is easy to see that 
taking the gradient of such a scalar field yields a vector field that everywhere
points inwardly.

<p>

A material particle, introduced anywhere into the field, will be compelled 
towards the boundary<sup>3</sup>, which behavior may only be interpreted,
cosmologically<sup>4</sup>, as resulting from some sort of universal law of
repulsion<sup>5</sup>.  Such an other-worldly physical picture only persists,
though, as long as the background space has a <i>non-positive
curvature</i><sup>6</sup>, i.e. its geometry is either flat<sup>7</sup> or
hyperbolic<sup>8</sup>. 

<p>

If, contrary to our initial assumptions, however, the background space happens
to be of a constant <i>positive curvature</i><sup>9</sup>, and assuming that the
coordinated, material system fully covers<sup>10</sup> the extent of the background space,
then the boundary will, necessarily, become "squeezed" into a
point<sup>11</sup>.  But since this purely topological transformation does not
affect the direction of the gradient&#8212;thus leaving the boundary-pointing
nature of the physical flow perfectly unscathed&#8212;any newly
introduced particles into this system can now easily be seen as having an
<i>attraction towards</i> a point, rather than a <i>repulsion away</i> from
one. 

<p>

So, requiring none other than the basic notions of "Gaussian scalar fields" from the
quantum theory and "positive curvature induced compactification" from topology,
a mathematically robust picture of a local gravitational action<sup>12</sup>
has been attained.  Such a picture perhaps gives one a nice intuition<sup>13</sup> 
for how the phenomenon of gravity in our own universe might really<sup>14</sup> work.

<p> 1. A twelfth century natural philosopher might have entitled this, "A Triviall Derivationne 
of a Nicely Gravitational Cosmic Order from an Wholly Quantum Philosophickal Starting Pointe".

<p>

2. These values might represent, for example, a rigorously calculated quantum
state (e.g. the 1s atomic orbital<sup>a</sup>), or a smooth lump of "primordial essence",
or perhaps even some kind of well-behaved "primeval ooze". The concept of
"harmonic spatial functions" should suffice as a mathematico-metaphysical initial 
condition.

<p>

3. Against the direction of the gradient, i.e. outwardly, as if it were caught
in something of an astral centrifuge.

<p> 

4. This term implies more than one might presume. Kant used the phrase
"rational cosmology" to refer to the discipline now known as "theoretical
physics". Contrast this with today's tendency to use the unqualified word
"cosmology" in specific reference to the notion of <i>large-scale</i>, or
<i>macro</i>-cosmological physical structures, on the order of planets and up.


<p>

5. To generalize the point in footnote #3, this is an "anti-gravitational"
picture, wherein matter always appears to be repelled away from a (central) point. 

<p>

6. It is crucial to gain an intuition for whatever coordinate system we may
choose to fix (localize) the field values, since it must conform to&#8212;and
therefore perhaps suffer distortions from&#8212;the geometry of the background
space<sup>b</sup>.  

<p> 7. Euclidean, or "table-like" 

<p> 8. Lobachevskian, or "saddle-like" 

<p>
9. Giving it a Riemannian, "sphere-like" geometry.

<p> 10. Satisfying the formal condition of bijectivity between the mathematical 
domain and the physical space.

<p> 11.

One-point compactification (aka "the Alexandroff extension") will occur
regardless of the magnitude of the curvature! The relevant topological
principle can be summarized as such: "All <i>n-</i>balls may be smoothly 
contorted into the shape of an <i>n-</i>sphere".  As examples, a) any 1-ball
(line segment) compactifies into a 1-sphere (circle), such that the bounding
points may be removed and replaced with a single "point-at-infinity", and b)
any 2-ball (disc) compactifies into a 2-sphere (sphere), such that the bounding
circle suffers the very same replacement operation. The latter
example is more interesting than the former, due to the considerations in
footnote #6.

<p>
12. Compatible with relativistic considerations, i.e. not requiring Newtonian
"action-at-a-distance". 

<p>

13. So we can now sense a causally robust natural "mechanism" of which Descartes and Leibniz would've
probably gleefully approved; Newton, at least privately, might've too. 

<p>

14. Philosophical metaphysicians should be on guard for such ontologically-tinged
invocations of the idea of "reality"!

a. As Tim Maudlin points out&#8212;in stark contrast to the received wisdom of
undergraduate chemistry students everywhere&#8212;the creation of an exact,
ontologically-grounded definition (or even a loose-yet-well-reasoned
signification) for those perfect abstractions that are called "atomic orbitals"
is far from having been attained.  In the Bohr picture, they were understood to
be the work of planet-like electrons that circled (classically) about a
star-like nucleus.  But de Broglie then envisioned them as somehow being 
diffused throughout space, which is the thread that Schr&ouml;dinger tugged in
order to deduce the concept of vibratory wave functions. At this point,
fuzzy intuitions could still be invoked in order to investigate "mechanically proper"
schemes for an <i>a priori</i> calculable theory of light and matter, but this
would all have been so exceedingly speculative as to possess almost no conceivable
mortal purpose. So, Born (by this time something of an elder statesman to a
community of unruly upstarts, though still, himself, Einstein's junior) then
developed his namesake "rule" to interpret the waves as fields of probabilities
related to the outcomes of the empirically <i>en vogue</i> regime of scattering
experiments.  Mathematically, though, "what atomic orbitals are" need not have
any more metaphysical significance than [the highly Platonic notion of] being a
fat breed of sinusoidal curve.  Physicists, of course, must have a hard time
swallowing the thesis that our entire material world results from nothing other
than interactions between undulatory objects of a kind of higher-order
trigonometry, each of said objects with their peculiar forms, sizes,
frequencies and phase rotations.  Perhaps if the physicists only pried a little
deeper into Leibniz's <i>oeuvre</i> in order to gain a better sense for
his highly "quixotic" (read as: fervently anti-Newtonian) <i>Weltanschauung</i>,
they might think twice about rejecting it so out-of-hand!

<p>

b. See "Quantum Theory of Localizable Dynamical Systems" (Dirac, 1948) for
an in-depth, authoritative investigation along these lines; the cognitive
minefield known as "the problem of non-locality in quantum mechanics" thereby
appears to be nullified.
