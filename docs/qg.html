<h2>

A Triviall Derivation of a Gravitational Universe from an Wholly Quantum
Theoretical Starting Pointe<sup>1</sup> 

</h2>

<p>

Consider a spherically bounded Gaussian-like continuous distribution of scalar
values<sup>2</sup> in a Euclidean space of n-dimensions. 

<p>

It is easy to see that the gradient of such a distribution consists of a field
of inward-pointing vectors. An inertial, massive test particle placed
anywhere in the field will thereby get pulled towards the boundary<sup>3</sup>, 
which behavior may only be interpreted, cosmologically, as
resulting from some sort of "universal law of repulsion"<sup>4</sup>. 

<p>

Such an other-worldly physical picture only holds, though, as long as the
background space has a non-positive curvature<sup>5</sup>, i.e. its geometry
is either flat<sup>6</sup> or hyperbolic<sup>7</sup>. 

<p>

If, however, the background space happens to consist of a constant positive
curvature<sup>8</sup>, and assuming that the coordinate system fully covers
the extent<sup>9</sup> of the background space, then the spherical boundary of
the scalar distribution must be "squeezed" into a point<sup>10</sup>. 

<p>

But since this purely topological transformation does not alter the
boundary-pointing direction of the physical flow, any test particles can now
easily be seen as having an <i>attraction towards</i> a point, rather than a 
<i>repulsion away</i> from one. 

<p>

So, using nothing but the basic notions of "Gaussian distribution" from the
quantum theory and "positive curvature induced compactification" from topology,
a mathematically robust picture of a local gravitational action<sup>11</sup>
has been attained.  Such a picture perhaps gives one a nice intuition<sup>12</sup> 
for how the phenomenon of gravity in our own universe might really<sup>13</sup> work.

2. These values might represent, for example, a rigorously calculated quantum
state (e.g. the 1s atomic orbital), or merely a smooth lump of "primeval
essence". The mathematical condition of harmonicity should be sufficient.

3. Against the direction of the gradient, i.e. outwardly. 

<p>

4. In this "anti-gravitational" picture, matter appears to be repelled away
from a (central) point. 

<p>

5. It is crucial to gain an intuition for whatever coordinate system we may
choose to fix (localize) the field values, since it must conform to the
geometry of the background space.  See "Quantum Theory of Localizable Dynamical
Systems" (Dirac, 1948) for an in-depth, authoritative investigation along these lines.

<p> 7. Lobachevskian, or "saddle-like"

8. Giving it a Riemannian, "sphere-like" geometry embedded in an n+1
dimensional Euclidean space and altering the physically significant subset of
it from an n-ball into an n-sphere. 

<p> 9. Satisfying the formal condition of bijectivity between the mathematical 
domain and the physical space.

<p> 10. Compactification must occur regardless of the magnitude of the curvature! 

<p>
11. Compatible with relativistic considerations, i.e. not requiring Newtonian
"action-at-a-distance". 

<p>
12. In a causally robust, "mechanical" sense: Descartes and Leibniz would've
probably both approved; Newton, at least privately, probably would've too. 

<p>

13. Philosophical metaphysicians should be on guard for such ontologically
pregnant invocations of the idea of "reality"!
