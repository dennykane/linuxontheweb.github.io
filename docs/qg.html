Consider a spherically bounded, Gaussian-like continuous distribution of scalar
values<sup>2</sup> in a Euclidean space of <i>n-</i>dimensions. 

<p>

It is easy to see that the gradient of such a distribution consists of a field
of inward-pointing vectors. A test particle of finite mass, placed
anywhere in the field, will thereby get pulled towards the boundary<sup>3</sup>, 
which behavior may only be interpreted, cosmologically<sup>4</sup>, as
resulting from some sort of "universal law of repulsion"<sup>5</sup>. 
Such an other-worldly physical picture only persists, though, as long as the
background space has a non-positive curvature<sup>6</sup>, i.e. its geometry
is either flat<sup>7</sup> or hyperbolic<sup>8</sup>. 

<p>

If, however, the background space happens to be of a constant positive
curvature<sup>9</sup>, and assuming that the coordinate system fully covers<sup>10</sup> 
the extent of the background space, then the spherical boundary of
the scalar distribution will become "squeezed" into a point<sup>11</sup>. 
But since this purely topological transformation does not affect the
boundary-pointing direction of the physical flow, any test particles can now
easily be seen as having an <i>attraction towards</i> a point, rather than a 
<i>repulsion away</i> from one. 

<p>

So, requiring none other than the basic notions of "Gaussian distribution" from the
quantum theory and "positive curvature induced compactification" from topology,
a mathematically robust picture of a local gravitational action<sup>12</sup>
has been attained.  Such a picture perhaps gives one a nice intuition<sup>13</sup> 
for how the phenomenon of gravity in our own universe might really<sup>14</sup> work.

<p> 1. A twelfth century metaphysician might have called this, "A Triviall Derivationne 
of a Nicely Gravitational Universe from an Wholly Quantum Philosophickal Starting Pointe".

<p>

2. These values might represent, for example, a rigorously calculated quantum
state (e.g. the 1s atomic orbital), or merely a smooth lump of "primordial
essence". The mathematical concept of "harmonic spatial functions" should work as
a sufficient condition.

<p>
3. Against the direction of the gradient, i.e. outwardly. 

<p>
4. This term implies more than one might presume. Kant used the phrase "rational cosmology"
to refer to the discipline now known as "theoretical physics".

<p>

5. In this "anti-gravitational" picture, matter appears to be repelled away
from a (central) point. 

<p>
6. It is crucial to gain an intuition for whatever coordinate system we may
choose to fix (localize) the field values, since it must conform to&#8212;and
therefore perhaps suffer distortions from&#8212;the geometry of the background
space.  See "Quantum Theory of Localizable Dynamical Systems" (Dirac, 1948) for
an in-depth, authoritative investigation along these lines. 

<p> 7. Euclidean, or "table-like" 

<p> 8. Lobachevskian, or "saddle-like" 

<p>
9. Giving it a Riemannian, "sphere-like" geometry.

<p> 10. Satisfying the formal condition of bijectivity between the mathematical 
domain and the physical space.

<p> 11.

One-point compactification (aka "the Alexandroff extension") will occur
regardless of the magnitude of the curvature! The fundamental topological
principle can be summarized as such: All <i>n-</i>balls can be trivially
stretched into the shape of an <i>n-</i>sphere.  As examples, a) any 1-ball
(line segment) compactifies into a 1-sphere (circle), such that the bounding
points may be removed and replaced with a single "point-at-infinity", and b)
any 2-ball (disc) compactifies into a 2-sphere (sphere), such that the bounding
circle suffers the very same replacement operation. The latter
example is more interesting than the former, due to the considerations in
footnote #6.

<p>
12. Compatible with relativistic considerations, i.e. not requiring Newtonian
"action-at-a-distance". 

<p>
13. In a causally robust, "mechanical" sense: Descartes and Leibniz would've
probably both approved; Newton, at least privately, probably would've too. 

<p>

14. Philosophical metaphysicians should be on guard for such ontologically-tinged
invocations of the idea of "reality"!
