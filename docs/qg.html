Consider a finite, Gaussian-like, continuous field of scalar values<sup>2</sup>
in a Euclidean space of <i>n-</i>dimensions.  I denote the set of radially
symmetric (<i>n</i>-1-spherical) terminal points of the field as "the boundary".  It is easy to see that 
taking the gradient of such a scalar field yields a vector field that everywhere
points inwardly.

<p>

A material particle, introduced anywhere into the field, will be compelled 
towards the boundary<sup>3</sup>, which behavior may only be interpreted,
cosmologically<sup>4</sup>, as resulting from some bizarre sort of universal law of
repulsion<sup>5</sup>.  Such an other-worldly physical picture only persists,
though, as long as the background space has a <i>non-positive
curvature</i><sup>6</sup>, i.e. its geometry is either flat<sup>7</sup> or
hyperbolic<sup>8</sup>. 

<p>

If, contrary to our initial assumptions, however, the background space happens
to be of a constant <i>positive curvature</i><sup>9</sup>, and assuming that
the "reference-framed" material system fully covers<sup>10</sup> the extent of
the background space, then the boundary will necessarily become "squeezed", so
to speak, into a non-singular point<sup>11</sup>.  But since this purely
topological transformation does not affect the direction of the
gradient&#8212;i.e. the boundary-pointing nature of the physical flow is left
perfectly unscathed&#8212;any newly introduced particles into this system can
now easily be seen as having an <i>attraction towards</i> a point, rather than
a <i>repulsion away</i> from one. 

<p>

So, requiring none other than the basic notions of "Gaussian scalar fields" from the
quantum theory and "positive curvature induced compactification" from topology,
a mathematically robust picture of a local gravitational action<sup>12</sup>
has been attained.  Such a picture perhaps gives one a nice intuition<sup>13</sup> 
for how the phenomenon of gravity in our own universe might really<sup>14</sup> work.

Main Footnotes

<p> 1. A twelfth century natural philosopher might have entitled this, "A Triviall Derivationne 
of a Nicely Gravitational Cosmic Order from an Wholly Quantum Philosophickal Starting Pointe".

<p>

2. These values might represent, for example, a rigorously calculated quantum
state (e.g. the 1s atomic orbital<sup>a</sup>), or a smooth lump of "primordial essence",
or perhaps even some kind of well-behaved "primeval ooze". The concept of
"harmonic spatial functions" should suffice as a mathematico-metaphysical initial 
condition.

<p>

3. Against the direction of the gradient, i.e. outwardly, as if it were caught
in something of an astral salad spinner. When the scalar field is envisaged
topologically as a "spatial hill", this can also be interpreted as motion in a
downward direction<sup>b</sup>. 

<p> 

4. This term implies more than one might presume. Kant used the phrase
"rational cosmology" to refer to the discipline now known as "theoretical
physics". Contrast this with today's tendency to use the unqualified word
"cosmology" in specific reference to the notion of <i>large-scale</i>, or
<i>macro</i>-cosmological physical structures, on the order of planetary sizes
and up.


<p>

5. To generalize the point in footnote<sup>3</sup>, this is an "anti-gravitational"
picture, wherein matter always appears to be repelled away from a (central) point. 

<p>

6. It is crucial to gain an intuition for whatever coordinate system we may
choose to fix (localize) the field values, since it must conform to&#8212;and
therefore perhaps undergo distortions resulting from&#8212;the geometry of the background
space<sup>c</sup>.  

<p> 7. Euclidean, or "table-like" 

<p> 8. Lobachevskian, or "saddle-like" 

<p>
9. Giving it a Riemannian, "sphere-like" geometry.

<p> 10. Satisfying the formal condition of bijectivity between the mathematical 
domain and the physical space.

<p> 

11. One-point compactification (aka "the Alexandroff extension") will occur
regardless of the magnitude of the curvature! The relevant topological
principle can be summarized as such: "All <i>n-</i>balls may be smoothly
contorted into the shape of an <i>n-</i>sphere"<sup>d</sup>.  See the footnote<sup>e</sup>
for a discussion about non-singularity.

<p>
12. Compatible with relativistic considerations, i.e. not requiring Newtonian
"action-at-a-distance". 

<p>

13. So we can now sense a causally robust natural "mechanism" of which Descartes and Leibniz would've
probably gleefully approved; Newton, at least privately, might've too. 

<p>

14. Philosophical metaphysicians should be on guard for such ontologically-tinged
invocations of the idea of "reality"!

a. As Tim Maudlin points out&#8212;in stark contrast to the received wisdom of
undergraduate chemistry students everywhere&#8212;the creation of an exact,
ontologically-grounded definition (or even a loose-but-well-reasoned
signification) for those perfect abstractions called "atomic orbitals"
is far from having occurred.  In the Bohr picture, they were understood to
be the work of planet-like electrons that revolved (classically) about a
star-like nucleus.  But de Broglie then envisioned them as somehow being 
diffused throughout space, which is the thread that Schr&ouml;dinger tugged in
order to deduce the concept of vibratory wave functions. At this point in time,
fuzzy intuitions could still be invoked in order to investigate "mechanically proper"
schemes for an <i>a priori</i> calculable theory of light and matter, but this
would've been so exceedingly speculative as to possess almost no conceivable
mortal purpose. So, Born (by this time something of an elder statesman to a
community of unruly upstarts, though still, himself, Einstein's junior) then
developed his namesake "rule" to interpret the waves as fields of probabilities
related to the outcomes of the politically <i>en vogue</i> regime of scattering-type
experiments.  Mathematically, though, "what atomic orbitals are" needn't have
any more metaphysical significance than [the highly Platonic notion of] being a
rather voluminous breed of sinusoidal curve.  Physicists, of course, must have a hard time
swallowing the thesis that our entire material world results from nothing other
than interactions between undulating objects of a kind of higher-order
trigonometry, each of said objects with their peculiar forms, sizes,
frequencies and phase rotations.  Perhaps if physicists only pried a little
deeper into Leibniz's <i>oeuvre</i> in order to gain a better sense for
his highly "quixotic" (read as: fervently anti-Newtonian) <i>Weltanschauung</i>,
they might think twice about rejecting it so out-of-hand!

<p>

b. This motion should be seen to arise by virtue of a fundamental application
of standard particle-flowing-in-a-field type of thinking.  One should not think
that there is any reason&#8212;at the current level of [purely mathematical]
construction&#8212;to mandate any <i>determinate species</i> of <i>physical</i>
field, because the entire point of this exercise is to gain some sense of a
kind of, as Kant would have it, "unknowable noumenal reality" that underlies
all possible appearances. Perhaps this form of reasoning should be termed
"dynamical mathematics" as opposed to any kind of physics: mathematical,
theoretical, or otherwise. Along these lines, we might want to assert that
mathematics consists of the totality of intuitively discernable concepts that
must first of all be intrinsically <i>believed</i> before any of the
knowledge-based sciences (starting with physics) can begin to get underway.  So
this might lead us to think that we must first be capable of believing things
in order for knowing things to have any proper meaning.

<p>

c. See "Quantum Theory of Localizable Dynamical Systems" (Dirac, 1948) for
an in-depth, authoritative investigation along these lines; the cognitive
minefield known as "the problem of non-locality in quantum mechanics" thereby
appears to be nullified.


<p>

d. As examples, a) any 1-ball
(line segment) compactifies into a 1-sphere (circle), such that the bounding
points may be removed and replaced with a single "point-at-infinity", and b)
any 2-ball (disc) compactifies into a 2-sphere (sphere), such that the bounding
circle suffers the very same replacement operation. The latter example is more
interesting than the former, due to the considerations in footnote<sup>6</sup>.  

<p>

e. We can make the claim that the compactified boundary is "non-singular" due
to the implicit assumption of Dirichlet boundary conditions&#8212;which just
means that all field values must vanish there&#8212;on the equation that
enables us to derive the sort of Gaussian ("harmonically nice") distribution
that we initially had in mind to generically represent the global "shape" of
the scalar field.
