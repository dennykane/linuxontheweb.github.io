Abstract: We show the existence of the Yang-Mills "mass gap" by 1) highlighting
the condition that we call <i>boundary heaviness</i> in 3-dimensional Gaussian manifolds,
and 2) showing how this condition yields "point particles" when the manifolds are 
analyzed on background spaces of constant positive curvature.

<b>I. The Problem</b>
<p>
<b>Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap.</b> Prove
that for any compact simple gauge group G, a non-trivial quantum Yang-Mills
theory exists on &#8477;<sup>4</sup> and has a mass gap &#916;&gt;0.

<br><br>
<p>
<b>II. The Solution</b>
<p>
We imagine that there are finite manifolds<sup>b</sup> of dimension <i>n</i> that are non-trivial,
smooth, and vanish at their boundaries.

<p>

If the manifolds are defined, smoothly and bijectively, over a closed,
unbounded background space of constant positive curvature (an <i>n</i>-sphere),
then they must be "one-point compactified" at their boundaries.

<p>
The "compactified boundary points" will be set to <b>x</b><sub>0</sub>, i.e. the "initial" locations.

<p>

For each <b>x</b><sub>0</sub>, there is a natural "final" location,
<b>x</b><sub>f</sub>, at the polar opposite point of the (<i>n</i>-spherical)
background space.

<p>

A vector <b>x</b> is any interpolated sequence of locations that span between
<b>x</b><sub>0</sub> and <b>x</b><sub>f</sub> along a given longitude. The
plots of the measured quantities that are associated with each vector <b>x</b>
are designated as "spectra."

<p>

We imagine (<i>n</i>-1)-spheres of some arbitrarily large radius <i>r</i>, which 
are centered around each point in a given <b>x</b>.

<p>
Characteristic of each sphere is a hypervolume which we will
designate as its "mass," <i>m</i>.

<p>
We now consider how the masses change when 
<i>r</i>&rarr;0.

<p>

The question of the "mass gap" can be framed by way of comparing the values of
the different masses in <b>x</b> to each other. This comparison may be done for each
<i>r</i>.  In other words: How are the slopes of an individual "mass spectra" affected as 
<i>r</i>&rarr;0?


<p>

For simplicity, we now imagine the manifolds to be perfectly Gaussian in their
"unwrapped" aspects<sup>c</sup>.

<p>

First, for <i>n</i>=1, it can be trivially shown that <u>there is no mass gap</u>
because mass(<b>x</b><sub>0</sub>)/mass(<b>x</b><sub>f</sub>)&rarr;0 as
<i>r</i>&rarr;0, and the slope of the spectrum approaches +&infin;. We
designate this condition: <i>boundary lightness</i>.

<p>

Next, for <i>n</i>=2, it can be shown that all masses (<b>x</b><sub>0</sub> to
<b>x</b><sub>f</sub>) are approximately constant, and that the slope of the
spectrum is approximately 0.  In other words, the spectrum appears to be a
horizontal line that can be brought arbitrarily close to the vacuum state as
<i>r</i>&rarr;0, and so <u>a mass gap cannot be demonstrated</u>.  We designate
this condition: <i>boundary neutrality</i>.

<p> 

Finally, for <i>n</i>=3, the situation is effectively the reverse of
<i>n</i>=1, because
mass(<b>x</b><sub>0</sub>)/mass(<b>x</b><sub>f</sub>)&rarr;&infin; as
<i>r</i>&rarr;0, and the slope of the spectrum approaches -&infin;. In other
words, the more that one tries to bring the absolute quantity of the mass of
<b>x</b><sub>0</sub> down to 0, the more that it "stands out" from the rest of
the masses in <b>x</b>, and appears as an isolated "point particle,"<sup>d</sup>
and <u>a mass gap has been demonstrated</u>.  We designate this condition:
<i>boundary heaviness</i>.

<b>III. Theory Construction</b>

<p>

Various theories may be constructed by considering the manifolds to be
oscillators of various "harmonic shapes" which may each vibrate at various
frequencies and with various intensities. With respect to the background space,
they may each have distinct coordinate locations and orientations.
Constraints may be applied to restrict their vibrational "energies," and to
impose certain conditions of symmetry and/or smoothness on the linear
combination of the entire set of manifolds.  We consider these to be the
essential variables of any non-trivial Yang-Mills theory.

<b>IV. Conclusion</b>

<p>

The above outline may not be sufficiently detailed or rigorous to qualify as a 
formal proof, but it is our considered opinion that no essential concepts 
are missing from it.





<br><br>
<p>
<b>V. Glossary of Terms</b>
<p>

<b>&#8477;<sup>4</sup></b>: the ambient space that is needed to embed the
<i>n</i>-spherical "vacuum state" when <i>n</i>=3.

<p>

<b>G</b>: the "gauge group," which is the metric that allows us to assign the
radii <i>r</i> that circumscribes each point in <b>x</b> and to calculate the
value of the differential hypervolumes (the "masses") which are bounded by
the differential hypersurfaces of the manifolds and the hypersurface of the 
vacuum state.

<p>
<b>&#916;:</b> the infinitesimal "step down" that is found, when <i>n</i>=3, in a 
spectrum of infinitely negative slope, as <i>r</i>&rarr;0.

<b>Notes</b>

<p>
a. I prefer not looking at the date (or time) if I can get away with it. I am fairly
confident that today's date is somewhere between September 7 and September 15.

<p>
b. The individual manifolds are the "quanta" of any Yang-Mills theory

<p>
c. In a flat (rather than curved) background space, the manifolds would appear to be
perfectly Gaussian.

<p>
d. In other words, a classical "atom in the void."
