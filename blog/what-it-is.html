What is Linux on the Web?
</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>

<a href="/"><i>Linux on the Web</i></a> (<a
href="https://github.com/linuxontheweb/linuxontheweb.github.io/">github
repo</a>) is primarily a way to allow people to use their web browsers in the
same way that they used their computers before the web started becoming
commonplace in the early 1990's. Computers are called "computers" precisely
because they let us perform general computations. But due to the high resolutions
of modern displays and infinite variety of media content, it can sometimes be
difficult to "see the forest for the trees" when it comes to the possibilities that
general computing machines offer us.

<p>

<i>Linux on the Web</i> is not technically related to Linux &mdash; which is
a specific piece of software called a kernel that mediates between
application software and computer hardware. It relates more to the fundamental
character of the Unix style of computing, which puts an emphasis on textual
interfaces, configurability, and the usage of small, easily
maintainable utility programs that "do one thing and do it well," allowing for good
interoperability and seamless workflows.

<p>

So when certain people talk about using Linux, they are actually talking about
the ways in which they put their computing machines directly to use, rather
than being mere end-users of a company's line of software products. Those
people might be hobbyists or researchers or they might even be trying to build
their own software development companies. The big idea behind <i>Linux on the
Web</i> is that such people might start finding it in their best interests to
have a "web first" mindset in order to accomplish the same kinds of things that
had previously been done via "native" computing methods.

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>

When people surf the web, they expect to see some kind of content, whether that
content comes in the form of a scientific paper or an bit of gossip. The
content is downloaded by their web browsers from a remote server in
order to be locally displayed.  But even though the content might temporarily
get saved in the browser's cache (to save time and bandwidth during later
visits), it is still effectively the property of the domain from which it was
downloaded. 

<p>

<i>Linux on the Web</i>, though, doesn't really have any end-user content. You
can think of it as a highly functional sort of "New Tab." The existence of any
content is up to the user, whether it's imported into the system (e.g. by drag
&amp; drop) or created from within the system itself. But the question of content is
just the tip of the iceberg, because the motivating purpose behind <i>Linux on the
Web</i> is figuring out how to actively unlock some content's potential via whatever
automated workflow that one can imagine. It is, furthermore, within the framework of
automation that the notion of "content" gets transformed into that of "data."

<p>

Any content (or data) within <i>Linux on the Web</i> is primarily meant to be
stored within a new kind of 
<a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system">
browser-based file system</a> 
that is completely within
users' control. The files that are stored in this file system cannot
be accessed in the same simple way that the files on users' desktops can be
accessed &mdash; it is said to be "sandboxed."  To effectively access it, there
should rather exist some well-engineered javascript code executing within users' web
browsers. 

<p>

So the first goal of <i>Linux on the Web</i> is to be viewed as a <u>very</u>
well-engineered software layer that mediates between users and the files that
are stored in the "sandboxes" that are maintained by their browsers.  It is
only after this goal has been satisfactorily attained that all other
possibilities related to specific workflows or applications might start being
realized.

<h2>Who cares about this?</h2>

<p> 

But isn't this diatribe a rather pointless waste of natural language? I only ever
wanted to work on <i>Linux on the Web</i>, so I wouldn't need to worry over any
kind of explanation or sales pitch or techno-vision-babble or what have you.
<i>Linux on the Web</i> is really meant to be nothing other than a
<i>ding-an-sich</i>, which is just "grad-student-ese" for a thing-as-such. In
other words, I wanted to make something that shows itself, phenomenologically,
as it is, in itself: all excess verbiage being so much hot air.

<p>

The real point of this "blog post," I guess, is to just have <i>something</i>
to post to Hacker News other than the same old link to the same old web-based
desktop environment.
