<h1>
What is Linux on the Web?
</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>

<a href="/"><i>Linux on the Web</i></a> is primarily a way to allow people to
use their web browsers in the same way that they used their computers before
the web started becoming commonplace in the early 1990's. Computers, in other
words, are called "computers" precisely because they let us perform general
computations. Due to the high-resolution nature of modern computer graphics, it
can be hard, however, to "see the forest for the trees" when it comes to the
possibilities that general computing machines afford us.

<p>

<i>Linux on the Web</i> is not technically about Linux, which is nothing but a
specific piece of software &mdash; known as a kernel &mdash; that mediates
between application software and computer hardware. It is more about the
essential character of the Unix style of computing, which puts an emphasis on
textual interfaces, configurability, and setting up systems filled with fairly
small utility programs that "do one thing and do it well," allowing for good
interoperability and seamless workflows.

<p>

So when people talk about using Linux, they are actually talking about the ways
in which they put their computing machines directly to use, rather than being
mere end-users of a company's software product. These kinds of people might
be hobbyists or researchers or they might even be trying to build their own
software development companies. The big idea behind <i>Linux on the Web</i> is
that such people might start finding it in their best interests to go all-in
with modern web technology in order to accomplish the same kinds of things that 
had previously been done via "native" computing methods.


<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>

When people surf the web, they are expecting to see some kind of content,
whether this content comes in the form of a vexing scientific paper or an
amusing bit of gossip. The content is downloaded by their web browsers from a
remote domain in order to be locally displayed.  But even though the content
might get temporarily cached by the browser in order to save time and bandwidth,
the content is still effectively owned by the domain from which it was
downloaded. 

<p>

<i>Linux on the Web</i>, though, doesn't really have any content. You can
rather think of it as a highly functional sort of "New Tab." The existence of
any content is up to the user, whether it's imported into the system (e.g. by
drag &amp; drop) or created from within the system itself. The notion of
content is just the tip of the iceberg, because the larger point to <i>Linux on
the Web</i> is figuring out how to actively unlock the potential inherent in
content via whatever automated workflow that one can imagine. It is within the
paradigm of automation that the notion of "content" gets transformed into that of
"data."

<p>

All of the content (or data) is, first and foremost, meant to be stored within
a local file system that is completely within users' control. The files that
are stored in this new kind of a browser-based file system, though, cannot be
accessed in the same simple way that the files on users' desktops can be
accessed.  There should rather be some well-engineered javascript code running
in users' web browsers in order to put this local storage method most
effectively to use. So the first goal of <i>Linux on the Web</i> is to be the
<u>most</u> well-engineered of all code that mediates between users and the
files that are stored in their browsers.
